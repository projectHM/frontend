# Project Title
C & D


problem: lack of knowledge about the cost of datacenter and cloud.
action: i researched more about the problem and decided to create a single web app using react to increase the knowledge about the difference between the data centre and the cloud.
result: after using this app, business owners now are aware of the difference, and they can take the right decision and know whether they need a data centre or cloud.
